# Jason Keatley CP1404 Practicals

## regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
- My accuracy was fairly on point but I noticed I started allocating more estimated time towards the more challenging pracs.

## regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
- I learned to review my code after taking a short break to pick up errors that I may have missed.
- It was interesting seeing how other people wrote code or viewed problems but also gave feedback on my work in a
positive regard. 
- Also learned that an ideal review would have multiple code reviewers for the best outcome as some reviewers may not
pick up on conventions or functionalities.
## regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
- I think the pracs each gave valuable lessons but some of the longer assignment style questions could have been
narrowed down to focus on the point of the question more.

## Include proper Markdown links to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.
